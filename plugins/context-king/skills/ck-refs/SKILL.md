# ck refs — Symbol Reference Locator

Use this command after `ck find-symbol` when you need fast reference locations.

## Syntax

```bash
ck refs "<symbol>" [--path <folder-or-file>] [--top <n>] [--ignore-case]
```

## Typical usage

```bash
ck refs "TypedGatewayPayment"
ck refs "RequestTerminalRefundAsync" --path src/Modules/PaymentProcessing/
```

## Output

Tab-separated rows:

```
<score>  <file:line>  <line snippet>
```

- `score` prioritizes exact full-symbol matches over identifier-only matches.
